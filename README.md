# Personalized-Health-and-Fitness-Recommendation-System
A machine learning-powered Personalized Health and Fitness Recommendation System that generates customized exercise and diet plans based on user input. Built using Random Forest (scikit-learn) on a 14,000-row dataset, with a Flask web app for real-time recommendations.


## Overview  
This project is a **machine learning-powered web application** that provides **personalized exercise and diet recommendations** based on user input. The system is built using **Random Forest (scikit-learn)**, trained on a **14,000-row dataset**, and deployed using **Flask** to offer real-time predictions via a user-friendly web interface.  

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Processing & Exploration (Jupyter Notebook)**  
   - Loaded and cleaned dataset (from Kaggle).  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Engineered features for better model performance.  

2. **Model Training (Jupyter Notebook)**  
   - Used **Random Forest** to train two models:  
     - **Exercise Recommendation Model**  
     - **Diet Recommendation Model**  
   - Evaluated model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix).  
   - Saved trained models as **.pkl (pickle) files**.  

3. **Web App Development (PyCharm & Flask)**  
   - Created a **Flask-based web application** to interact with users.  
   - Integrated **pretrained models (.pkl files)** for real-time predictions.  
   - Designed **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** templates for user input and result display.  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Data preprocessing & model training)  
- **Flask** (Backend for web deployment)  
- **PyCharm** (Development environment)  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend for user interaction)  

## **How It Works**  
1. **User Inputs Health Data** (Age, BMI, Health Conditions, etc.).  
2. **Pretrained Models Predict Personalized Exercise & Diet Plans**.  
3. **Flask Web App Displays Recommendations** in a user-friendly format.
